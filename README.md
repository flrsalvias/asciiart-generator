# asciiart-generator
Convert your .jpeg pics to ascii art in text format

# How it works ?
Asciiart-generator works with the module Pillow, in Python.

# How to use it ?
You can use it by instaling Pillow (put pip install pillow), and by running main.py. You have to put your image in .jpeg in the same folder as main.py.

You also have to change the line 6 `with Image.open("picture.jpg") as image:` (the ("**picture**.jpg")) by the name of the file.
